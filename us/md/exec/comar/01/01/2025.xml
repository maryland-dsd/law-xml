This review shall evaluate how the mechanism interacts with utility rate design, arrearage management practices, and existing customer protections to determine its effectiveness in lowering energy burden and stabilizing accounts for OHEP-eligible households. The examination shall assess whether the mechanism is consistently applied, sufficiently coordinated with energy assistance programs, and appropriately structured to prevent energy insecurity and utility disconnections, and whether refinements or enhancements are warranted.</text>

The examination shall also evaluate how USPP interacts with rate design, arrearage management, and other affordability tools, and whether modifications are warranted to reduce energy insecurity and prevent disconnections among low-income households.</text>
