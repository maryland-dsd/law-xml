    <heading>Purpose and Scope.</heading>
    <text>This chapter applies to a comprehensive induction program for new teachers. The purpose of this regulation is to provide guidance for local school systems to establish a high quality induction program that addresses critical professional learning needs of new teachers, improves instructional quality, and helps inductees achieve success in their initial assignments, resulting in improved student learning and higher retention in the profession. Recognizing that "one-size-fits-all" induction programs do not meet the needs of new teachers, these regulations establish the components of an induction program, allowing local school systems to build on their current programs.</text>
