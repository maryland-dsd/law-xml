Fishing in these areas may be permitted for payment of a fee and they may be stocked with fish artificially propagated by commercial hatcheries or purchased from persons licensed to sell fish.</text>
          <text>B Any person desiring to operate a fee fishing lake under the Natural Resources Article, §4-11A-20, Annotated Code of Maryland, shall apply first to the Department for and secure a fee fishing lake permit costing $25 a year and expiring on the 31st day of December following date of issue. The applicant, in addition to other information required by the Department, shall state the size of the lake or pond, the location of the lake or pond, and the species of fish to be stocked. The permit shall entitle the holder and the holder's guests to fish for and take fish from the areas so licensed by any means, with the exception of explosives or chemicals. All fish removed under the terms of this permit shall be identified by a metal tag of a type approved by the Department or by a bill of sale when transported by tank. The fish may be taken without regard to seasons, creel, or possession limits.</text>
          <text>C The permittee shall submit annual reports not later than the next January 10 following the date of expiration and the report shall accompany the application for renewal of the permittee's license.</text>
